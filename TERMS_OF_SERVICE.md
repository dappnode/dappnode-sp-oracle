The foregoing limitations and disclaimers shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose. You acknowledge and agree that the limitations of liability afforded us hereunder constitute a material and actual inducement and condition to entering into these Terms, and are reasonable, fair and equitable in scope to protect our legitimate interests in light of the fact that we are not receiving consideration from you for providing the Smooth.

No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter the terms of these Terms.

If any portion of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or enforceability will not affect the other provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable portion will be given effect to the greatest extent possible. The failure of a party to require performance of any provision will not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
